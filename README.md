# Apex

Experimental project to play around with latest Angular (6).
Fetches a list with F1 drivers and presents them in a list.
Click on any driver opens a view with Driver's details.
Sorting and filtering is also available for the list.

### What is Apex?
F1 term describing the middle point of the inside line around a corner at which drivers aim their cars.

### What this baby can do :)
- Fetches and presents a list of Formula 1 Standings (currently on for a specific year).
- The list has bidirectional sorting on all of its attributes, by clicking the proper title.
- A search field on top allows you to filter the list based on driver's or constructor's name.
- Clicking on any row will show driver's information on the left.
- The url is changing according the driver's selection. The url is deep-linked when application is initiated. So copying and sending the url, let you navigate directly to a drivers info.
